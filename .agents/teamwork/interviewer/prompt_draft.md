Implement the comprehensive consolidation of features and menus across all roles in sipjam-app according to the design and recommendations in docs/REKOMENDASI_PENGGABUNGAN_FITUR_DAN_MENU.md, while ensuring zero feature loss.

Integrity mode: development

## Requirements

### R1. Comprehensive Feature and Menu Consolidation
Consolidate all 7 feature clusters across all user roles (Guru Reguler, Wali Kelas, Guru Piket, Administrator, Kepala Sekolah, Pengawas Dinas, and Superadmin) as specified in docs/REKOMENDASI_PENGGABUNGAN_FITUR_DAN_MENU.md, streamlining sidebar navigation, eliminating duplicate view rendering, and grouping related workflows into cohesive sub-tabs.

### R2. Zero Feature Loss Guarantee
Ensure all existing functionalities, forms, modals, action buttons, filters, exports, validations, and role-specific workflows across every user role remain 100% intact, fully accessible, and operative with zero regression.

### R3. Transparent Backward Compatibility and Aliasing
Provide transparent aliasing or route/view redirection for legacy view IDs and automated tour selectors (data-tour) so that existing links, bookmarks, and automated test selectors continue to function correctly alongside the consolidated sub-tab structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Menu Consolidation & Role Navigation
- [ ] All 7 clusters described in docs/REKOMENDASI_PENGGABUNGAN_FITUR_DAN_MENU.md are consolidated into their target menu structure for each role (Guru Reguler, Wali Kelas, Guru Piket, Administrator, Kepala Sekolah, Pengawas Dinas, and Superadmin).
- [ ] Redundant top-level menu items are grouped into cohesive sub-tab views as specified in the recommendation document.

### Zero Feature Loss & Backward Compatibility
- [ ] All role-specific forms, modals, tables, actions, and features remain present and functional.
- [ ] Legacy view IDs and data-tour selectors resolve or alias seamlessly to their corresponding views or sub-tabs without breaking existing references.

### Code Integrity & Verification
- [ ] TypeScript compilation (npx tsc --noEmit) completes with zero errors.
- [ ] Next.js production build (npm run build) completes successfully.
- [ ] Existing automated test suites (npm test) pass without failures.
- [ ] Regression tests covering the consolidated navigation and view transitions pass.
